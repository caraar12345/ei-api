> This tool uses Sentry.io for error and performance tracking. 
> Your Egg, Inc. ID will be sent to the Sentry servers -- but it will be redacted on the server side **so I will not be able to see it**.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Config
- Only one thing can be configured - the path base / root path.
  - If you're using a reverse proxy, this means you can have multiple endpoints on one domain by changing the base of the path to something else.
  - The [FastAPI docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/behind-a-proxy/) do a better job of explaining than I ever could!
- **Environment variable**: `EI_ROOT_PATH`
  - Defaults to `/`
